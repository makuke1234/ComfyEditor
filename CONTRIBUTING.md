This project's main goal is to achieve an enjoyable end product. Every bit of help
is appreciated. Feel free to report any bugs that you may find during your own
conduct of testing. Be warned, that I may discard any bug reports that have not been
produced on the latest version of the software. Also, feel free to suggest any feature
that you may want or request further documentation. There is no such thing as too much
documentation.
